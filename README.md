# The-Button-Game

This is a game between 2 players, PLAYER_ONE and PLAYER_TWO ,each one of the players has a button to press and the player who presses the button seven times faster than the other player wins, each player has a 7 LEDs dedicated to indicate how many LEDs he has succeeded to turn on.  
With each button click for each of the players a led turns on until one of them succeeds to turn on his 7 LEDs and win which makes clicking the button irrelevant for each of the players and has no effect.
