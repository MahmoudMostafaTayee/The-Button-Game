# 🎮 The Button Game

## 📜 Overview

The **Button Game** is a two-player game where each player has their own button to press. The goal of the game is to press the button **seven times faster** than the other player. Each time a player presses their button, one of their 7 **LEDs** lights up. The first player to light up all 7 LEDs wins!

The game stops once a player lights up all 7 LEDs, and further button presses from both players will have no effect. 

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Two players**: PLAYER_ONE and PLAYER_TWO each have a button.
2. Every time a player presses their button, **one LED lights up** for that player.
3. The first player to light up **7 LEDs** wins the game!
4. When a player reaches 7 LEDs, the game stops and no further button presses matter.
